# CAP Theorem

> **Guidelines:** Provide a brief introductory passage on the CAP theorem, including points such as what it states, who proposed it, and its significance in the context of software system design. *[Limit to 3 paragraphs]*

## Consistency

> **Guidelines:** In the context of the CAP theorem, explain the concept of consistency. However, avoid going into detail about the different types of consistencies here. There will be a dedicated section for that. *[Limit to 1 paragraph]*

## Availability

> **Guidelines:** Explain the concept of availability in the context of the CAP theorem and contrast it with the general concept of availability as a non-functional system requirement. *[Limit to 2 paragraphs]*

## Partition Tolerance

> **Guidelines:** Explain the concept of partition tolerance in the context of the CAP theorem. Discuss why acknowledging the fact that network partitions do occur in distributed systems is key to understanding the CAP theorem. *[Limit to 2 paragraphs]*

# Consistency Patterns

> **Guidelines:** Provide a brief introductory paragraph on what consistency patterns are in the context of the CAP theorem and why understanding them matters. *[Limit to 1 paragraph]*

## Strong Consistency

> **Guidelines:** Explain the concept of strong consistency in the context of the CAP theorem. Provide an example of database replication supported with a sequence diagram to illustrate how this consistency pattern works in that context. *[Limit to 2 paragraphs & a diagram]*

## Weak Consistency

> **Guidelines:** Explain the concept of weak consistency in the context of the CAP theorem. Provide an example of database replication supported with a sequence diagram to illustrate how this consistency pattern works in that context. *[Limit to 2 paragraphs & a diagram]*

## Eventual Consistency

> **Guidelines:** Explain the concept of eventual consistency in the context of the CAP theorem. Provide an example of database replication supported with a sequence diagram to illustrate how this consistency pattern works in that context. *[Limit to 2 paragraphs & a diagram]*

# CAP Theorem and Databases

> **Guideline:** Provide opening remarks on why the CAP theorem should guide database selection. *[Limit to 1 paragraph]*

## ACID and BASE

> **Guideline:** Provide a brief overview of the acronyms ACID and BASE in the context of databases and explain their relationship to the CAP theorem. *[Limit to 3 paragraphs]*

## SQL and NoSQL

> **Guideline:** Provide a brief overview of SQL (relational) vs. NoSQL (non-relational) databases. Emphasize that traditionally, distributed databases were NoSQL databases, and the CAP theorem is most relevant to their design. *[Limit to 2 paragraphs]*

## CA Databases

> **Guidelines:** Explain what is meant by CA databases and provide examples of databases that fall into this category. For instance, PostgreSQL is a CA database. *[Limit to 1 paragraph]*

## CP Databases

> **Guidelines:** Explain what is meant by CP databases and provide examples of databases that fall into this category. For instance, MongoDB is a CP database. *[Limit to 1 paragraph]*

## AP Databases

> **Guidelines:** Explain what is meant by AP databases and provide examples of databases that fall into this category. For instance, Cassandra is an AP database. *[Limit to 1 paragraph]*

## Database Selection Guided by CAP

> **Guidelines:** Provide concluding remarks on how the CAP theorem can guide database selection. *[Limit to 1 paragraph]*

# Resources

> **Guidelines:** List any resources you used for research. This can include academic papers, textbooks, blog posts, YouTube videos, and even AI assistants like ChatGPT. *[Simply list the resources, there is no need for proper citation!]*
