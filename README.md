## Description

The CAP theorem, a fundamental principle in the field of distributed computing and databases, postulates that in any distributed data store, only two out of the three following properties can be achieved simultaneously: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. This theorem has profound implications on how distributed systems, especially databases, are designed and operated.

In this assignment, you will delve into the CAP theorem and its implication in software system design when it comes to selecting the right database for your application. Please refer to the `REPORT.md` file where on outline is provided. Your task is to research and write out the report based on the outline and guidelines therein. Your report should help readers understand the CAP theorem in the context at hand.
